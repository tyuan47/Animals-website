            <font size="5" color="darkred"><bold>Gorillas need vegetation to survive, as they feed on plants and often build nests in trees to rest. Commercial activities such as agriculture, mining, and farming, make people cut down the trees of their habitat reducing the availability of food. Currently, 17 percent of gorillas live in protected areas, while the rest inhabit forests where they face several dangers.</bold></font>

        <p>
            <font size="5" color="red"><bold>There is a close connection between habitat loss and poaching. Until the 1980s, it was almost impossible to access the dense vegetation areas where gorillas live, but after clearing some areas, making some roads and devastating large zones of forests, the access to find gorillas got a lot easier for poachers. </bold></font>

        <p>
            <font size="5" color="orangered"><bold>Poaching is illegal hunting, most of the times for commercial purposes, or with the intention the get a monetary retribution. Poachers can kill gorillas to sell their meat or various parts of their body, or sometimes they capture gorillas and keep them alive and to sell them as “exotic” pets or for private collections of animals. Moreover, it is common that gorillas are victims of traps aimed at other animals, and they die or get seriously injured.</bold></font>
        </p>
        <p>
            <font size="5" color="yellow"><bold>Given the genetic similarity between humans and gorillas, they are also victims of outbreaks that affect people, triggering likewise epidemics among the members of a single population or even reaching other populations.</bold></font>
        </p>
        <p>
            <font size="5" color="lime"><bold>Countries where gorillas live, like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are troubled by political conflicts that usually end in wars, guerrillas or armed riots. Gorillas are not the objective, but humans invade their territory and gorillas lose areas where they can roam safely. Gorillas are continually under the threats resulting from human activities, and only we can get them out of the IUCN Red List of threatened species.</bold></font>
