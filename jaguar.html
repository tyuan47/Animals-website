        <p> <font size="5" color="whitesmoke">The Jaguar is considered an endangered species. They mainly live in tropical rain forests and They're threatened by poaching and humans have been destroying their habitats. Human development and building have caused many jaguar deaths and displacement. They are also highly prized by poachers so many will not hesitate to kill them for their spotted coats. They've been becoming increasingly rare especially in America. People are creating reserves for rain forest wildlife in hopes that endangered species will grow.   </font>
