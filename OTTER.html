        <p>
            <font size="5" color="black"><bold>Sea otters face a variety of threats that them in the endangered list. In the 1700s to 1800s, they were nearly hunted to extinction by fur traders, until gaining protection with the signing of the International Fur Seal Treaty of 1911, and became listed under the Marine Mammal Protection and Endangered Species Acts in the 1970s.</bold></font>

        <p>
            <font size="5" color="dark gray"><bold>Currently, oil spills from offshore drilling or shipping are an immense threat to sea otter populations. When sea otters come into contact with oil, it causes their fur to mat, which prevents it from insulating their bodies. Without this natural protection from the frigid water, sea otters can quickly die from hypothermia. The toxicity of oil can also be harmful to sea otters, causing liver and kidney failure as well as severe damage to their lungs and eyes. </bold></font>  
        </p>
        <p>
            <font size="5" color="black"><bold>Furthermore, pollution on land runs off into the ocean, contaminating the sea ottersâ€™ habitat. This can jeopardize their food sources, as well as harm them directly. Sea otters are often contaminated with toxic pollutants and disease-causing parasites as a result of runoff in coastal waters. In California, parasites and infectious disease cause more than 40% of sea otter deaths. Hundreds of sea otters have succumbed to the parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Sacrocystis neurona, which are typically bred in cats and opossums.</bold></font>
        </p>
        <p>
            <font size="5" color="dark gray"><bold>Direct conflict with humans, such as shootings and entrapment in fishing traps and nets also pose a major threat to sea otter populations. Since sea otters eat many of the same shellfish humans like to eat, such as sea urchins, lobster and crab, they often find themselves in the same areas fishermen like to harvest. Some shell fishers view sea otters as competition and a threat to their economic gain. Many fishermen use fishing gear that can entangle sea otters and cause them to drown.</bold></font>
        </p>
        <p>
            <font size="5" color="black"><bold>Moreover, the sea otter habitat range is expanding because of the lack of food in their current range. Unforunately, at the edge of their range, shark-bitten sea otters now account for more than half of the dead animals found. This now exceeds all other causes of mortality combined, and in the last few years, is actually driving a decline in the northern and southern parts of the population.</bold></font>
