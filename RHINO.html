        <p> <font size="5" color="tomato">   The Black Rhino is critically endangered. Their horns are highly desireable on the poaching market and the demand has becoe increasingly high as their population lessens. Wildlife organizations are trying to save the rhinos from extinction by mainly targeting poachers and trying to prevent the rhinos from being poaches. Hotlines for anonymous tips have been set up, workers monitoring them around the clock, and new sciences in DNA have allowed poachers to be rightly persecuted.
        The decline in Black Rhinos are also hurting developing countries where rhinos are a large source of income for their economy.</font>
