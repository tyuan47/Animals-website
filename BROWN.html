        <p> <font size="5" color="salmon"> Although the Brown Bear population is currently stable it is important for humans to make sure that stays constant. During the 19th and 20th century they were nearly hunted to extinction but thankfully they were able to recover their population. Being a top predator means they keep many other animal populations in check. They also help dispense seeds which benefits the enviorment as a whole. </font>
