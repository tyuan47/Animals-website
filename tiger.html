        <p> <font size="5" color="coral">The Bengal Tiger is currently an endangered species. They mostly live in India and other parts of Asia as the apex predator. They help maintain the enviorment they are in and it is said that with one bengal tiger 25,000 acres of forest  can be protected. Trading and poaching of the tigers has only recently been banned. People prize these tigers as status symbols and they are even used in folk cures. They are also suffering because of lack of prey due to human poaching.</font>
