        <h1>The Blue Whale</h1>
        
        <p> <font size="5" color="white">   The Blue Whale is the largest animal on the entire planet. At the top of the food chain they impact all other marine life in their enviorment. The Blue Whale is currently endangered due mostly to the major overhunting during the 1900s and  toxic wastes being thrown into the ocean. Whales being harmed from certain fishing tools also poses a threat that humans can currently help with by working with fishers to be more whale friendly. </font>
