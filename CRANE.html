            <font size="5" color="black">As the tallest North American bird, the whooping crane stands at about 5 feet with a wing span of 7 feet or more. Due to over-hunting and habitat loss from deforestation, the last migrating flock dwindled to an all-time low of 15 birds in 1941. The wild flock has slowly increased to over 300 currently, but still remain in the critically endangered list as all the wild birds habit in one small, concentrated area, and the population could be wiped out by disease, bad weather, or human impacts.</font>
