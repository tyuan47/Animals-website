            <font size="5" color="black"><bold>The dangerously low population of snow leopards can be attributed by human poaching and the overgrazing of livestock. The bones, skin and organs of large cats are valuable in traditional Asian medicine. Tigers are the prefered species for this purpose, but tigers are so rare that it is almost impossible to find one in the wild so snow leopards are substituted for tigers.</bold></font>

            <font size="5" color="black"><bold>Furthermore, humans have pushed ever further with their livestock into the snow leopard’s habitat. Overgrazing damages the fragile mountain grasslands, leaving less food for the wild sheep and goats that are the snow leopard’s main prey. With less food for the wild sheep and goats, there become fewer of these animals for the snow leopard. This leaves the snow leopard with little choice but to prey on the domestic livestock for their own survival, and often killed by unhappy farmers.  </bold></font>
