            <font size="5" color="black">Bumblebees, an essential pollinator of North America, became the first wild bee in the continental United States to be in danger of extinction. Pollinators of wildflowers and about a third of all U.S. crops, from blueberries to tomatoes, bumblebees faced a drastic drop of population in the late 1990's. The Bombus affinis, colloquially known as the bumblebee, plunged 90 percent in population, leading to its addition on the endangered species list. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service attributed its decline to a mix of factors including disease, pesticides, climate change and habitat loss, all factors perpetuated by the presense of humans. The once flourishing species exist only in few, scattered populations in 13 states.</font>
