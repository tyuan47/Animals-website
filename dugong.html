            <font size="5" color="white"><bold>Dugongs, who are related to manatees, are commonly known as sea cows, as they graze on sea grass in the shallow western Pacific and Indian ocean. These majestic creatures are now vulnerable because of the loss of their sea grass, which provides their food and homes. More development and industry around their homes have caused water pollution that damages the sea grass. Without this sea grass, Dugongs will not have enough to eat and cannot breed normally. Not only that, but dugongs often accidentally get caught in fishing nets. </bold></font>
