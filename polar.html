            <font size="5" color="black"><bold>Polar bears, who spend most of their lives on the arctic ice, are now a vulnerable group, largely because of climate change. Changing arctic temperatures and warming oceans threaten the habitat of the polar bears where they hunt, eat, rest, and breed. Without the arctic ice, polar bears face malnutrition or even starvation as they go without a place to hunt. </bold></font>

            <font size="5" color="black"><bold>Not only this, but as polar bears are forced on shore into places where humans live, more and more dangerous interactions for the bears and humans have occurred. It might get much worse for the bears though, as increased industralization and offshore drilling creates a risk for oil spills that could prove fatal. </bold></font>
