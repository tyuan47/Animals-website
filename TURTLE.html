        <h1>Green Sea Turtle</h1>
        
        <p> <font size="5" color="black">   The Green Sea Turtles are usually found in tropical climate. They highly benefit the ecosystems they are currently living in. They help recycle nutrients back into the enviorment from the seagrass they eat, feeding other animal species.The Green Sea Turtle is currently endangered mainly due to harm caused by humans. Not all of the harm is even purposeful, the turtles often get caught in nets and hooks by accident. Human activity has also disrupted Green Sea Turtle nesting not allowing them to grow as much as they can as a population. 
            Organizations are trying their best to implement turtle friendly hooks and protecting the turtles habitats. </font>
